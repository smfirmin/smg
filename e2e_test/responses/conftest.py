"""Shared fixtures for the Responses API test suite.

Hosts the ``image_generation`` test fixtures for the three engine lanes:

* ``gateway_with_mock_mcp_cloud`` — OpenAI cloud backend (R6.2).
* ``gateway_with_mock_mcp_grpc_sglang`` — local SGLang + gpt-oss-20b via
  harmony (R6.3).
* ``gateway_with_mock_mcp_grpc_vllm`` — local vLLM + Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  via regular (R6.4).

Each fixture wires the gateway's MCP client to an in-process
``MockMcpServer`` so the image-generation path is exercised deterministically
and without external-service dependencies. Future R6.x PRs can copy the
gRPC fixture pattern to add ``web_search`` / ``file_search`` /
``code_interpreter`` tests once the corresponding tool stubs in
``infra/mock_mcp_server.py`` are uncommented.

Design notes
------------
* The gateway CLI exposes ``--mcp-config-path`` (see
  ``bindings/python/src/smg/router_args.py``) which takes a path to a YAML
  config deserialized into ``crates/mcp/src/core/config.rs::McpConfig``.
  Setting ``builtin_type: image_generation`` on a server makes the gateway
  route every ``{"type": "image_generation"}`` tool request through it
  instead of passing the tool to the upstream model.
* We connect with ``protocol: streamable`` which matches the ``FastMCP`` app
  produced by ``streamable_http_app()``. ``sse`` would also work but would
  require an extra event-stream hop per call.
